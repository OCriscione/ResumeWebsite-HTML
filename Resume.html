    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr>
    <p2>I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Cyber Security from the University at Albany (SUNY), where I completed my studies in August 2024. Currently, I serve as an Information Technology Specialist 2 at the New York State Office of Information Technology Services, where I have gained hands-on experience in disaster recovery and system analysis. I have strong skills in programming, web development, network security, information security, and mathematics, and I'm an active member of several honor societies and professional organizations. With a passion for continuous learning and growth, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in the fields of information technology, cyber security, and engineering. Additionally, I am preparing for the CompTIA Security+ and Cisco CCNA certifications to further enhance my expertise.</p2>
